# Solo-Levelling (Discord AI AutoChat Bot)

**Solo-Levelling** is a customizable and interactive Discord bot that sends automated messages from multiple accounts to multiple channels. It includes both **message randomization** from a `.txt` file and **AI-powered replies** using **Gemini Pro** (or your own AI API).

Originally based on [`Discord-auto-chat-py`](https://github.com/recitativonika/Discord-auto-chat-py) by @recitativonika, this project expands with AI integrations while preserving lightweight auto-chat functions.
