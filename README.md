# Solo-Levelling (Discord AI AutoChat Bot)

**Solo-Levelling** is a customizable and interactive Discord bot that sends automated messages from multiple accounts to multiple channels. It includes both **message randomization** from a `.txt` file and **AI-powered replies** using **Gemini Pro** (or your own AI API).

Originally based on [`Discord-auto-chat-py`](https://github.com/recitativonika/Discord-auto-chat-py) by [`@recitativonika`](https://github.com/recitativonika), this project expands with AI integrations while preserving lightweight auto-chat functions.

## üß† Gemini API Key (AI)
You‚Äôll need a Gemini Pro key from [`Google AI Studio`](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).
No ```.env``` is needed ‚Äî just put the key in ```config.yaml.```
  
---

## üß† Prompt Customization (prompt.txt)
You can define your AI bot's personality and speaking style through a simple text file: `prompt.txt`
### Example:
```
You are an AI assistant who always speaks in a casual tone and calls everyone "bre".
You must respond in English first. Keep your answers brief, but friendly.
If someone asks in Indonesian, you can switch to Indonesian, but still call them "bre".
Never say you are an AI assistant.
```
Tips:
* The prompt is used every time the AI replies to a user message.
* You can update the file anytime without restarting the bot.
* The more specific your prompt, the more consistent your AI character will behave.

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Browsers may auto-remove the javascript: prefix ‚Äî you may need to type it manually.
